# Interactive Photo Gallery

## About the project

On this solo project for my Treehouse tech degree, I was given a design and brief to create an interactive photo gallery, which is fully responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop. 

Using the search bar, the user can search through the images based on the caption name of each image. Based on their search, the gallery will return any images that match their search query.
